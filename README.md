# React-Random_Nascar_Driver

<h2>Simple react application that generates a random nascar driver, and displays their name and car number(2020).</h2>

The game allows you to click a button that generates a random driver from the 2020 Season(as of 10/9/2020 only 5 drivers are included, more will be added later.) The color scheme of the Card displaying the drivers information also changes to match their primary paint scheme colors.

This is nothing crazy or fantastically complicated, it was just a small app to help me practice working with Props, State, Events, and Components in React, while working with one of my favorite sports(NASCAR).

I will try and update this with more drivers and Paint Schemes down the road.

This was created in CodeSandbox, and is hosted via Netlify.

<h3>Upcoming Changes : </h3>

- Add the entire 2020 field ( Full Time Drivers ) with their main paint schemes.
- Update the User Interface so it is more appealing and looks better.
- Add more inforamtion to the schemas of the drivers ( i.e. driver bio, picture, current team, 2019 standing finish, etc... )
